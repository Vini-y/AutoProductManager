**AutoProductManager**

**Description:**
AutoProductManager is a Python script designed to automate the process of managing products within a specific online system. It utilizes the PyAutoGUI library to simulate user interactions with the system's graphical user interface (GUI).

**Features:**
- **System Login:** The script automates the login process to the system using predefined credentials.
- **Database Import:** It imports product data from a CSV file into the script.
- **Product Registration:** AutoProductManager iterates over each entry in the imported database and registers the products into the system.
- **Optional Fields Handling:** It handles optional fields such as product descriptions efficiently.
- **Time Optimization:** By automating repetitive tasks, AutoProductManager saves time and reduces manual effort.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- PyAutoGUI
- Pandas

**Usage:**
1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries (PyAutoGUI and Pandas) are installed.
2. Download or clone the script to your local machine.
3. Place your product database in CSV format (e.g., "produtos.csv") in the same directory as the script.
4. Update the system URL and login credentials in the script if necessary.
5. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
6. Sit back and let AutoProductManager handle the product management process for you.

**Note:** Ensure that the system URL, login credentials, and CSV file structure align with the expected format for successful execution.
